# canvist business model

The editor, its server, and every binding are free forever under the Unlicense. canvist charges for **running** the service, never for the code. [The monetisation research](./research/monetisation.md) has the evidence behind this.

## Principles

- **No licence keys, watermarks, private registries, or loader-based billing.** The Unlicense makes them unenforceable, and both CKEditor and TinyMCE show they cost goodwill.
- **Bill per monthly active document (MAD):** a document with at least one sync session or API mutation in the billing month. It tracks real cost (memory per loaded `yrs` document) and treats web, desktop, mobile, Flutter, React Native, and Lynx the same.
- **Free plans have hard caps. Paid plans get warnings, never automatic upgrades.** Hosted features degrade on overage; the client never goes read-only.
- **Add-ons work on any paid plan.** One feature never forces a tier jump.
- **Self-hosting is a first-class path.** We publish the exact binary we run, with a guide.

## Plans (provisional, pending real cost benchmarks)

The plan table lives in the user docs, at [`docs/src/cloud/billing.md`](../src/cloud/billing.md#plans), where the website's pricing page is tested against it.

OSI-licensed projects get Builder free. Companies with fewer than five people get 50% off for the first year.

These prices are **not final**. They are published only after canvist Cloud measures real memory per document and Railway cost per MAD, and the owner approves them.

## Infrastructure

Every hosted service runs on Railway. Each service builds from a Dockerfile in the repo: staging deploys every push to `main` and production deploys each app release, so nobody runs their own instance by hand. The marketing site, docs, Sync, and Convert are separate Railway services in one project, with staging and production environments.
