## [0.2.0](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (2026-10-30)

### 💥 Breaking Change

#### Rename `canvist_editor` to `canvist_core`

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #192](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/192)

The editing engine (editor state, commands, selection motion, keymaps, input rules, and history) is now the `canvist_core` crate, and `canvist_headless` re-exports it as `canvist_headless::canvist_core`. Through the `canvist` crate it is `canvist::core`. Nothing else about the API changed, so updating the dependency and the paths is the whole migration:

```rust
// Before
// or, through the crate apps install
use canvist::core::Editor;
// After
use canvist_core::Editor;
use canvist_editor::Editor;
use canvist_headless::canvist_core::Platform;
use canvist_headless::canvist_editor::Platform;
```

### 🚀 Feature

#### Add ink drawings and kinetic type, drawn by the canvas itself

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #179](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/179)

Two canvas-native extensions, each behind its own Cargo feature and included in `full`.

**`Ink` (`ink`)** adds `ink` blocks: freehand drawings in a space 1000 units wide and `height` units tall, scaled with their column.

- Strokes are `points` lists of `x, y` pairs with an optional `color` and `width`.
- Commands: `insertInk`, `addInkStroke`, `undoInkStroke`, and `clearInk`. Query: `inks`.
- Each stroke is one undo step and one Yjs update.
- HTML writes a `<figure data-type="ink" role="img" aria-label="Drawing">` with an SVG of the drawing and the strokes as JSON. Markdown writes the same HTML, and both read it back.

**`Kinetic` (`kinetic`)** adds the `kinetic` mark, whose `effect` is `wave`, `shake`, `pulse`, or `rainbow`.

- Commands: `setKinetic`, `toggleKinetic` (another effect switches to it), and `unsetKinetic`. Query: `kineticEffect`.
- HTML writes `<span data-kinetic="…">`. Markdown keeps the text.

`canvist_layout`:

- `DisplayItem::Stroke` is new, and the SVG renderer, `canvist_web`'s Canvas2D painter, and `canvist_paint` draw it with round caps and joins. A stroke holds a range of the new `DisplayList::points`, read with `DisplayList::stroke_points`, and its bounds, so no item but a text run owns memory and lists of text stay as fast to build as before.
- `LeafStyle::Ink` lays out drawings. `Motion` and `AttrBinding::Motion` set how text moves.
- `DisplayOptions::time` moves kinetic text glyph by glyph, and `DisplayList::animated` says when a later frame would differ. Without a time, text is still, as it should be for readers who prefer reduced motion.
- The HTML renderer draws ink as inline SVG in a figure named as an image, and animates kinetic text with CSS, off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- New default features `ink` and `kinetic` hold this code. `canvist_web` builds without them, as it does without `tables`.

`canvist_core`: `ValueType::sample` gives lists two items, so lists of pairs get valid samples.

`canvist_canvas` and `canvist_canvas_wasm` turn on `canvist_layout`'s new `ink` and `kinetic` features.

#### Render the canvas, and edit text frames with the real text editor

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #134](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/134)

`canvist_paint` (new) draws a canvas page through one `Painter` contract. Backends:

- vello on wgpu: WebGPU in browsers, and Metal, Vulkan, and DX12 natively;
- `vello_cpu`, for PNG export and the browser fallback;
- SVG, with text kept as text.

The scene walker culls to the viewport and has level of detail. Text is shaped with parley and the bundled Atkinson Hyperlegible font, so a frame wraps the same on the canvas, in a PNG, and in SVG. With 10,000 nodes on screen, encoding a GPU frame takes about 1 ms and a 1080p CPU frame about 4 ms.

`canvist_canvas` adds `TextSession` (feature `editor`). It opens a text frame in a `canvist_core::Editor`, places the caret where you click, draws the caret and selection in the overlay, and hands the document back on close. It also adds `Canvas::tool_named`.

`canvist_core` adds `Editor::into_state`, so a host that lent a document to an editor can take it back.

`canvist_canvas_wasm` (new, unpublished) runs the canvas in the browser on WebGPU with a CPU fallback, behind the `@canvist/canvas` demo.

#### Dictation: drafts that show faint at the caret and settle into the document

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #229](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/229)

Speech now becomes text the way people expect from live captions: the words still being said appear at the caret, rewrite themselves as the speech model changes its mind, and settle into the document once they're final.

`canvist_core` adds `Editor::dictate`, which takes each segment of speech as a `Transcript::Partial` or `Transcript::Final`. Provisional text never enters the document: it isn't sent to collaborators, saved, exported, or added to history. Final segments are inserted at the caret in segment order, each as its own undo step (`EditKind::Dictation`). Segments join the text around them with one space, except before punctuation and after opening brackets and quotes, and the first transcript replaces a selection as typing does. `EditorState::dictation` reports the draft (`Dictation::provisional`) and the text inserted a moment ago (`Dictation::settling`), mapped through every later change. `Editor::stop_dictation` drops the draft.

`canvist_layout` adds `DocumentLayout::set_provisional`, behind the new `provisional` feature (on by default; the browser editor turns layout's defaults off, so it carries none of it). The block holding the draft is laid out with it inserted, so the text after it reflows as it will once the text is final, while every query (hit testing, carets, selections, line navigation, slots, and line ranges) stays in document offsets. A caret where the draft sits shows after it. The draft is drawn at 45% opacity and breathes gently while the animation clock runs. `DisplayOptions::settling` fades newly final text into ink over 450 ms. Without a clock, as for reduced motion, the draft is steady and final text is solid at once.

`canvist_headless` adds `Doc::stop_dictation`.

`canvist_ffi` adds `Editor.dictate(segment, text, isFinal)`, `stopDictation()`, and `dictationDraft()` for the iOS and Android bindings, `EditorChange.dictation`, and `Editor.setAnimations` with `Frame.animated`, so a view that asks for a frame on each display refresh animates drafts, settling text, and kinetic text. Animations are off until the view turns them on.

Revising a draft relays out its paragraph in about 29 µs in a 10,000-paragraph document, and a native frame after a revision takes about 30 µs.

#### Add text alignment, typography, character count, and placeholders

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #159](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/159)

Four editing extensions beyond the StarterKit, each behind its own Cargo feature in `canvist_extensions` and part of `full`:

- `TextAlign`: a `textAlign` attribute on paragraphs and headings, with `setTextAlign`, `toggleTextAlign`, `unsetTextAlign`, a `textAlign` query, and `Mod-Shift-l`, `e`, `r`, and `j`. HTML reads and writes TipTap's `style="text-align: …"`.
- `Typography`: TipTap's 22 smart punctuation rules plus Remirror's `<->`, configurable with `without` and `with_output`. Rules that end in a digit fire on the space or punctuation after them.
- `CharacterCount`: `characters` (grapheme clusters), `words`, and `characterLimit` queries, and `setCharacterLimit`. Edits that would go past the limit don't apply.
- `Placeholder`: hint text for empty blocks, with TipTap's `showOnlyCurrent` and `includeChildren`, a `placeholder` query, and `setPlaceholder`.

`canvist_extensions::extras()` lists every extension beyond the StarterKit with its default configuration.

Supporting changes:

- `canvist_core`:
  - `Extension::update_filters` lets an extension refuse a local update after its fix-ups, like TipTap's `filterTransaction`. The update is undone, the command reports that it did not apply, and `Editor::can` answers the same way. The filters are collected when the editor is built, so an editor whose extensions have none pays nothing per update.
  - `EditorState::settings`, `EditorTransaction::set_setting`, and `commands::set_setting` keep per-editor values such as a limit or placeholder text outside the document, its history, and collaboration. Dry runs restore them.
  - Extension metadata now lists only the nodes the built schema has.
  - `InputRule::on` names the typed characters that can complete a rule whose pattern ends in a group or class, so it doesn't run on every punctuation keystroke.
  - Input rules no longer panic when their 64-byte look-back starts inside a multi-byte character, which `**bold**` after a line of `€` or CJK text could trigger.
- `canvist_layout`:
  - Lines align to a block's `textAlign` attribute: left, centre, right, or justified by widening spaces. Server-rendered HTML writes the matching `text-align`.
  - A row now rereads its `dir` and `textAlign` attributes when the block changes. Before, changing `dir` kept the old direction until the row was rebuilt.
  - `DisplayOptions::placeholder` draws placeholder text, faded, in an empty block.
- Clipboard: pasted block attributes keep only the ones the block type declares.

The `@canvist/web` bundle budget moves to 354,000 gzipped bytes, for update vetoes, editor settings, `can()` dry runs, and text alignment, which every host runs.

#### Add `canvist_core`, the platform-agnostic editing engine

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #90](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/90)

Add `canvist_core`, the platform-agnostic editing engine, and `Transaction::allocate_id` in `canvist_model` so commands can create blocks inside a transaction.

- `EditorState` holds the document, selection, stored marks, and IME composition. Every change goes through `EditorState::change` or `EditorState::apply_steps`, which map the selection and composition, clear stale stored marks, and keep the document non-empty.
- Commands as plain functions: typing with mark inclusivity, deleting by grapheme, word, line, or document (joining blocks and lifting out of containers at block boundaries), marks, select all, block selections, and IME composition.
- Selection motion by grapheme cluster and word (UAX #29), line, and document, treating embeds and atomic blocks as single stops. Vertical motion goes through the `LineNavigator` trait, with a paragraph-based fallback for headless use.
- An outline notation for before/after command tests.

#### Add the `Editor`: history, keymaps, input and paste rules, and the `Extension` trait

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #92](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/92)

- `Editor` and `EditorBuilder` assemble the schema, commands, key bindings, and rules from extensions, sorted by priority, and route every update through one place that runs extension fix-ups and records history.
- `History` is the boundary the collaboration crate replaces; `UndoHistory` groups typing (including IME composition) and deletions by time (500 ms by default), keeps other edits as their own steps, restores the selection, and limits depth.
- `Keymap` parses ProseMirror-style bindings such as `Mod-Shift-z`, with `Mod` meaning Cmd on Apple platforms and Ctrl elsewhere. `BaseKeymap` binds each platform's standard caret, deletion, Enter, select-all, and Escape keys.
- `InputRule` rewrites text as it is typed (block type, wrapping, marks, text replacement, and atomic blocks), runs only on whitespace or punctuation, and skips code blocks. Backspace right after a rule restores the typed text. `PasteRule` formats pasted text, for example into links.

#### Settle the `LineNavigator` interface that `canvist_layout` implements

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #103](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/103)

- `LineNavigator` now has `vertical(&mut self, doc, from: Caret, direction: VerticalDirection, goal_x: Option<f32>) -> Result<Option<VerticalMotion>, NavigationError>` and `line_edge(&mut self, doc, at: Caret, edge: LineEdge) -> Result<Caret, NavigationError>`. Methods take `&mut self` so layout can measure blocks lazily, and return errors instead of guessing when it cannot.
- `Caret` pairs a point with an `Affinity` (`Upstream` or `Downstream`), so the offset where a line soft-wraps can be the end of one line or the start of the next. `EditorState::affinity` tracks it: line and vertical motion set it, and every other change resets it to `Downstream`.
- `Env` holds the navigator mutably. Build one with `Env::new(now, &mut navigator)`, or `Env::headless(now)` for the `ParagraphNavigator` fallback. `Editor` methods now take `&mut Env`.
- `EditorError::Navigation` carries a navigator's error.

#### Add structural editing commands to `canvist_core`

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #91](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/91)

- Enter splits text blocks (a heading continues as a paragraph at its end), and Backspace and Delete join blocks across containers, adopting the rest of a joined list item or quote.
- Block types, block attributes, wrapping and lifting (such as blockquotes), and atomic blocks such as horizontal rules.
- Lists generic over list and item types: split, indent, outdent, join with the previous item, wrap, and toggle, converting between list types in place while keeping block ids.
- `Slice` for copy, cut, and paste: copying keeps partly selected containers around their children, and pasting merges open text at both ends and converts or flattens blocks the destination does not accept.
- Property tests that random command sequences keep every invariant and that every update's inverse restores the document exactly.

#### Add subscript, superscript, highlight, and TipTap's text style kit

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #155](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/155)

canvist's first extensions beyond TipTap's StarterKit, each behind its own Cargo feature in `canvist_extensions` (`full` enables every one), with TipTap's JSON names, commands, and keys:

- `Subscript` (`Mod-,`) and `Superscript` (`Mod-.`), which exclude each other.
- `Highlight`: `==text==`, `Mod-Shift-h`, and a `color` attribute (multicolour by default; `Highlight { multicolor: false }` matches TipTap's default).
- `TextStyle` with `Color`, `BackgroundColor`, `FontFamily`, `FontSize`, and `LineHeight`, which each add one attribute to the `textStyle` mark, with set and unset commands and a query for the shared value.

Supporting changes:

- `canvist_model`: `SchemaBuilder::block_attrs` and `mark_attrs` add attributes to types other extensions register, like TipTap's global attributes. `MarkSpec::excludes_registered` excludes marks only when the schema has them. `EmbedSpec::attrs` sets an embed's defaults.
- `canvist_core`: `commands::update_mark_attrs` rewrites one mark's attributes run by run, keeping each run's others.
- `canvist_layout`: `TextStyle::baseline_shift` and `TextPatch::baseline_shift` raise or lower text like CSS `vertical-align`, in canvas layout and server-rendered HTML alike. `AttrBinding::LineHeight` reads a mark's line height. The StarterKit theme styles `subscript`, `superscript`, and `textStyle.backgroundColor` and `lineHeight`. `TextStyle` has a new public field, so code that builds one literally must set `baseline_shift`.
- Clipboard formats: HTML reads and writes `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<mark data-color>`, and `<span style>`; Markdown writes `==text==` and GitHub's `<sub>` and `<sup>` tags and reads them back. Pasted marks keep only the attributes their type declares.
- `canvist_headless`: the `full` feature registers every extension by name in `Engine::named`, which `canvist_headless_wasm` and the Dart bridge enable. The browser editor still compiles the StarterKit only. `Engine::named` now registers names in one fixed order whatever order they are given in, so the same names always build the same schema and every binding nests and serializes marks alike.
- `@canvist/headless/full` and the Dart `canvist` package export a typed descriptor and handle for each new extension, generated from the new full metadata snapshot. `allExtensions` (TypeScript) and `Extensions.starterKit` (Dart) list them; `starterKit` is unchanged.
- Conformance fixtures can list `extensions` to add to the StarterKit, and every runner supports them.

The StarterKit theme's rules for blocks, marks, and embeds beyond the StarterKit sit behind a new `canvist_layout` feature, `theme-extensions`. `canvist_canvas`, `canvist_canvas_wasm`, and `canvist_paint` turn it on. `@canvist/web` builds without it, and its bundle budget moves to 352,000 gzipped bytes for the engine growth every host shares.

#### Add `canvist_headless`, the document model and editing engine with no UI

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #108](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/108)

Add `canvist_headless`, the canvist document model and editing engine with no UI, for servers, scripts, and tests.

- `Engine` registers extensions once (with typed handles) and is `Send + Sync`; each `Doc` is `Send`. Load and export ProseMirror/TipTap JSON, HTML, Markdown, and plain text, run typed or named commands against explicit selections, answer queries, paste, undo, and take `Snapshot`s.
- `Position` addresses text by block path and UTF-16 offset, the same in every language. `ErrorCode` gives every failure a stable name.
- The `collab` feature makes a `Doc` a Yjs peer and a y-sync server endpoint (`receive_sync` returns the reply and what to relay), and `validate` reports shared content the schema rejects. The `ssr` feature adds a `Renderer` for HTML and SVG through `canvist_layout` and `parley` with a bundled font. The default build has neither.
- `conformance/` holds language-neutral fixtures (input, operation script, expected output) that every binding runs; the Rust runner passes all 30.
- `canvist_core`: `Editor::apply_external` and `EditorState::apply_external` let a collaboration binding change the editor's own document, so a shared document is held once.
- `canvist_collab`: `Binding::rejected_blocks` counts shared items the schema hides, and the `sync` feature makes `Binding` and `SyncSession` `Send + Sync`.

#### Add `canvist_extensions`, the StarterKit, with one Cargo feature per extension

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #93](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/93)

Add `canvist_extensions`, the StarterKit, with each extension behind its own Cargo feature.

- Nodes: `Document`, `Paragraph`, `Heading`, `Blockquote`, `CodeBlock`, `HardBreak`, `HorizontalRule`, `BulletList`, `OrderedList`, `ListItem`, and `TaskList`, with TipTap's names, key bindings, and Markdown-style input rules.
- Marks: `Bold`, `Italic`, `Underline`, `Strike`, `Code`, and a non-inclusive `Link` with autolinking and linking on paste.
- Functionality: `History` keys and `TrailingNode`.
- `canvist_core` gains `UndoInputRule` (Backspace takes back an input rule before any other Backspace binding), `lift_empty_block`, and a public `wrap_in_list`, and its hot paths avoid scanning sibling lists so a keystroke costs the same at 100 or 100,000 blocks.
- A scripted-typing harness (`"## Hi⏎- one⏎two⇥"`) with JSON snapshots, property tests that random keystroke scripts keep every invariant and undo and redo exactly, and `divan` keystroke benchmarks at 100, 10,000, and 100,000 blocks.

#### Add mentions, hashtags, and emoji on a shared suggestion system

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #166](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/166)

Three extensions, each behind its own Cargo feature and part of `full`, share one suggestion engine, like TipTap's Suggestion utility and Remirror's suggesters. Typing `@`, `#`, or `:` after a space starts a suggestion. A `…Suggestion` query reports `{ char, query }`, a command replaces the trigger with the pick and a space, and Escape or a dismiss command hides it until the trigger is typed again.

- `Mention`: TipTap's `mention` embed with `id`, `label`, and `mentionSuggestionChar`, plus `insertMention`, `dismissMentionSuggestion`, and `mentionSuggestion`. Backspace after a mention turns it back into its trigger.
- `Hashtag`: a `hashtag` mark with a `tag`, marked as you type and paste, with `insertHashtag`, `dismissHashtagSuggestion`, `hashtagSuggestion`, and a `hashtags` list query.
- `Emoji`: TipTap's `emoji` embed with `name`, plus canvist's `emoji` attribute holding the character. It covers GitHub's 1,870 gemoji, `:shortcode:` as you type, `setEmoji`, `dismissEmojiSuggestion`, `emojiSuggestion`, and `searchEmoji({ query, limit })`.

Supporting changes:

- `canvist_model`: `Value::Map` holds nested attributes. JSON objects in attributes become maps instead of `null`, and they round-trip.
- `canvist_core`: `ValueType::List` and `ValueType::Record` describe structured query answers. Bindings generate typed lists and records from them.
- `canvist_collab`: maps in attributes travel through Yjs instead of being dropped.
- `canvist_layout`: `EmbedStyle::Label` gains a `fallback` attribute, drawn when the label's attribute is missing: after the prefix, or as `:value:` without one. The StarterKit theme draws an emoji without its character as `:name:` and a mention without a label as `@id`, as every export does. Code that builds a `Label` literally must set `fallback`.
- `canvist_headless`: query and command arguments accept JSON objects.
- Clipboard: HTML reads and writes TipTap's mention and emoji spans and canvist's hashtag spans. A mention without a label reads back without one. Plain text and Markdown write what a mention or emoji shows.
- `@canvist/headless` types list and record answers. The Dart `canvist` package answers with typed records, such as `({String char, String query})`, and its queries take arguments.

The `@canvist/web` bundle budget moves to 356,000 gzipped bytes and its wasm budget to 342,000, for JSON object and list values and list and record argument types, which every host runs.

The StarterKit theme's mention rule moves behind `canvist_layout`'s `theme-extensions` feature, beside the emoji rule, so hosts that compile only the StarterKit, such as `@canvist/web`, carry neither.

The Dart package's Flutter editor views turn on `canvist_layout`'s `theme-extensions` feature, so they style the extensions the package ships.

#### Add the headless, typed extension API (architecture Decision 8)

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #102](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/102)

- `canvist_model`: `Document::savepoint`, `rollback_to`, and `release`. A rollback restores the content, the version counter, every block revision, and id allocation exactly, so a dry run leaves layout caches warm. Savepoints nest.
- `canvist_core`:
  - `EditorBuilder::add` returns an extension's typed handle, behind `TypedExtension` and an unforgeable `Registration`.
  - `CommandSpec` and `QuerySpec` declare named commands and queries with typed, checked arguments (`Field`, `ValueType`). `Editor::run_named`, `command_named`, and `query` serve dynamic hosts, and `Editor::metadata` and `metadata_json` describe every node, attribute, command, and query for binding generators.
  - `Editor::can` and `EditorState::dry_run` answer whether a command would apply without changing anything. `Editor::chain` runs commands all or nothing as one undo step, and `EditorState::atomic` backs it.
  - `Extension::commands` now returns `CommandSpec`s, and `queries` and `nodes` are new.
  - Input rules run only when the typed character can complete their pattern, and unanchored rules search a bounded `Lookback` (64 bytes by default, or the current word for autolinks). A keystroke at the end of a long line no longer scans 500 bytes per rule.
- `canvist_extensions`: every extension has a typed handle (`HeadingHandle::toggle(HeadingLevel::H2)`, `MarkHandle::is_active`, `LinkHandle::href`, ...), argument-checked commands, queries, and node metadata. `StarterKit::add_all` returns all the handles.

#### Collaborate over y-websocket out of the box with `@canvist/web/collab`

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #165](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/165)

`@canvist/web/collab` joins a browser editor to a room on any server that speaks y-websocket's protocol: y-websocket's own server, canvist's `receiveSync` servers, or canvist Cloud Sync. The editor is the Yjs peer itself, so there is no `Y.Doc` to keep in step, and JavaScript Yjs peers in the room see the same document.

```ts
import { connect, createEditor } from "@canvist/web/collab";

const editor = await createEditor(element);
const connection = connect(editor, {
	url: "wss://sync.example.com",
	room: "notes",
});
await connection.whenSynced();
```

- `createEditor` from `@canvist/web/collab` loads a second WebAssembly module (`wasm-collab/`) with Yjs inside, so editors that don't collaborate never download it. `loadCollab(source)` loads it from elsewhere.
- `connect(editor, { url, room, params, clientId, reconnect, WebSocket })` returns a `Connection` with `status`, `synced`, `clientId`, `subscribe`, `whenSynced`, and `disconnect`. It reconnects with backoff and catches up both ways.
- Undo is per person: `Mod-z`, `editor.undo()`, and the `undo` command revert only this peer's changes, grouped by word as when editing alone.
- `canvist_headless`: `join_message()` and `Engine::join_sync` join a shared document over y-sync with no state of its own; `Doc::receive_sync_changes` also returns the commit of each remote change; `Doc::history_step` undoes or redoes and returns the update; `Doc::shared_history_key` and `Doc::shared_history_command` identify History's keys and commands on a shared document, which `press` and `run_named` now answer with the shared history. `Doc::edit` joins any follow-up the shared state needed to the update it returns, and integrating a collaborator's change no longer advances the document's clock (y-websocket echoes each update to its sender, which split typing into one undo step per key).
- `canvist_core`: `UndoGrouping` is the rule `UndoHistory` groups changes by, on its own, so a shared history can group the same way.

### 🐛 Fixed

#### Add clipboard formats to `canvist_extensions` behind the `clipboard` feature

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #94](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/94)

Add clipboard formats to `canvist_extensions` behind the `clipboard` feature (part of `starter-kit`).

- `clipboard::to_html`, `to_markdown`, and `to_plain_text` serialize a copied `Slice` in the markup TipTap renders and in CommonMark with GitHub task lists and strikethrough.
- `clipboard::from_html`, `from_markdown`, and `from_plain_text` parse pasted content back into a schema-valid slice: unknown markup degrades to text, bare paragraphs inside lists gain list items, and Google Docs' inline `font-weight`, `font-style`, and `text-decoration` styles become marks.
- The parsers are small and hand-written, adding no dependencies and no HTML5 or CommonMark engine to WebAssembly builds.
- `canvist_core`'s paste keeps the type of an open first block pasted into an empty block and keeps an explicit empty last block.

- **Move the repository to canvist/canvist.** canvist now lives at [github.com/canvist/canvist](https://github.com/canvist/canvist). Every repository, documentation, and badge link points there, the npm packages declare their repository, homepage, and issue tracker (with support@canvist.dev), and the release workflows run for the `canvist` organisation. The website footer has a Contact link to support@canvist.dev. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #148](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/148)

#### Keep `@canvist/web` lean when it compiles only the StarterKit

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #179](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/179)

`@canvist/web` compiles the StarterKit alone. It now carries no code for extensions its schema cannot reach:

- Clipboard codecs and StarterKit theme rules for extension blocks and marks compile only with their features.
- Table grids, ink drawings, and kinetic motion compile only with `canvist_layout`'s `tables`, `ink`, and `kinetic` features. Layout's hot paths read a row's grid part through accessors that are always `None` without `tables`.
- The editor builds its extension metadata the first time it is read, not on every build. The browser editor never reads it.

Across the extension layers, its bundle budget in `tools/bench/size.json` moves from 350,000 to 359,000 gzipped bytes, and its wasm budget from 340,000 to 345,000, for engine growth every host shares:

- JSON object and list values in attributes and command arguments.
- List and record argument types.
- The clipboard core's new block and mark handling.
- Extensions vetoing updates, `can()` dry runs, and editor settings.
- Text alignment and direction in layout.

#### Fit the web editor in its 350 KB budget

- `@canvist/web` now ships 349.8 KB gzipped, measured as an app bundles it (`npm run size`, enforced in CI). The WebAssembly module is optimized without inlining, which gzips smaller.
- `canvist_layout::css_number` formats CSS numbers without `core`'s float formatting, which no longer links into the module.
- `EditorState::change` and `InputRule::new` keep one copy of their logic instead of one per command and rule, and `Engine::metadata` is built on first use.

- **Drop metadata descriptions from the browser editor's module.** `@canvist/web` builds its WebAssembly module with `--cfg canvist_omit_docs`, which leaves the command, query, and argument descriptions out of `canvist_core`'s metadata. Only bindings that generate types read them, and the browser module never does. With `wasm-opt --converge`, the editor ships 349.1 KB gzipped, down from 349.97 KB, under its 350 KB budget. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #154](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/154)
