//! # `canvist_layout`
//!
//! Incremental text and block layout for the canvist editor, and the display
//! list every painter consumes.
//!
//! - A [`Theme`] maps block types, marks, and embeds to styles. Rules are
//!   data, keyed by schema names, so extensions contribute their own.
//! - A [`TextMeasurer`] measures text for the host platform. Layout batches
//!   every missing measurement of a relayout into one call and caches results
//!   by (font, segment).
//! - [`DocumentLayout`] breaks lines (UAX #14, CSS `pre-wrap` rules), orders
//!   bidi text (UAX #9), stacks blocks with their containers, estimates the
//!   height of blocks outside the viewport, and relays out only the blocks a
//!   [`Commit`](canvist_model::Commit) touched.
//! - Geometry queries: [`DocumentLayout::hit_test`],
//!   [`DocumentLayout::caret_rect`], [`DocumentLayout::selection_rects`], and
//!   the [`LayoutNavigator`] the editor uses for vertical caret motion.
//! - [`DisplayList`]: positioned text runs, rectangles, decorations, and
//!   node-view slots, with [`DisplayList::damage`] for dirty rectangles.
//! - Server rendering: [`to_svg`] paints a display list, and [`to_html`]
//!   writes semantic HTML plus CSS that wraps lines exactly where the canvas
//!   does. See the [CSS contract](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/blob/main/docs/internal/ssr-css-contract.md).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! use canvist_layout::DisplayOptions;
//! use canvist_layout::DocumentLayout;
//! use canvist_layout::FixedMeasurer;
//! use canvist_layout::LayoutOptions;
//! use canvist_layout::Theme;
//! use canvist_model::BlockSpec;
//! use canvist_model::Document;
//! use canvist_model::MarkSet;
//! use canvist_model::Point;
//! use canvist_model::Schema;
//!
//! let schema = Arc::new(Schema::builder().block(BlockSpec::text("paragraph")).build()?);
//! let mut doc = Document::new(schema, 1);
//! let block = doc.first_text_block().expect("new documents have one block");
//! let mut transaction = doc.transaction();
//! transaction.insert_text(Point::new(block, 0), "Hello, layout!", MarkSet::empty())?;
//! transaction.commit();
//!
//! let mut measurer = FixedMeasurer::new();
//! let mut layout = DocumentLayout::new(&doc, Arc::new(Theme::starter_kit()), LayoutOptions::new(80.0));
//! layout.layout_all(&doc, &mut measurer)?;
//!
//! // 14 characters at 9.6 px do not fit in 80 px, so the paragraph wraps.
//! assert_eq!(layout.line_count(block), Some(2));
//!
//! let display = layout.display_list(&DisplayOptions::viewport(0.0, 600.0));
//! assert!(canvist_layout::to_svg(&display).contains("Hello, "));
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
