//! The display list: the only thing painters see.
//!
//! Items are in paint order and in document coordinates. A painter
//! translates by the scroll offset, then draws each item: `fillText` per
//! [`DisplayItem::Text`] on the web, `<text>` in [`to_svg`](crate::to_svg),
//! glyph runs in vello, and so on. Slots are rectangles reserved for views the
//! host renders itself, such as images and checkboxes.
