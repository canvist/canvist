//! Typography: smart quotes, dashes, arrows, fractions, and symbols as you
//! type.
//!
//! The rules are TipTap's, plus Remirror's `<->` arrow. A rule whose
//! pattern has a capture group replaces only that group, so `1/2 ` becomes
//! `½ ` and keeps its space. Backspace straight after a rule fires puts
//! back what was typed.
//!
//! Input rules only run when the typed character is punctuation or white
//! space, so typing letters and digits never pays for them. TipTap's rules
//! that end in a digit (`2x3`, `^2`, `^3`) therefore fire on the space or
//! punctuation typed after them instead.
