/**
 * The canvist editor for the browser.
 *
 * canvist paints every pixel of the document on a canvas, measured by the
 * browser itself, so the canvas wraps each line exactly where canvist's
 * server-rendered HTML does and hydrating from that HTML moves nothing.
 * Commands, queries, and plugins are typed from what you register: calling
 * one you did not register is a type error.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { createEditor } from "@canvist/web";
 *
 * const editor = await createEditor(document.querySelector("#editor")!, {
 * 	content: { format: "markdown", input: "Hello **world**" },
 * });
 * editor.select({ path: [0], offset: 0 }, { path: [0], offset: 5 });
 * editor.commands.toggleItalic();
 * ```
 *
 * @module
